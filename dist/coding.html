            How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Coding.

        <div class="coding-story">
            <p>
                <section>
                    <p> Without any idea where to begin or what I needed to 
                        code, I knew coding was the path for me. So I got 
                        some tips on where to start. I downloaded Intellij 
                        and started coding in Java. In the beginning I did 
                        some simple tutorials, then I started taking online 
                        courses, but class work is really not my bag of 
                        chips as they say. I can't just sit and listen to 
                        a person who tells me how it should work. I rather 
                        just figure it out for myself, create my personal 
                        techniques, and go as fast or slow as I want. </p>
            
                    <p>Therefore I began by thinking about what kind of 
                        game I could make. A simple game for a n00b coder. 
                        So I made a snake game and a Super Mario Bros clone
                        and many more. But it was not challenging enough 
                        and I alreay wanted more. </p>
            
                    <p>I always loved the mysteries of the universe. I 
                        love science fiction movies. So why not make a 
                        space game. Where I can fly with a space ship 
                        and see distance stars and meet new species. 
                        This would mean I would have to think long and
                        hard about how to set up a game like that. What 
                        was needed? How do I seperate one thing from 
                        another. Is a asteroid the same "object" as a 
                        space ship? What would the rules of the game be?
                        Do I make something that should be popular or 
                        something that is unique?</p>
            
                    <p>My philosophy background came in handy here, 
                        to think of an object as a duality would become
                        a smart choice later on in the development of 
                        the game. So I started by making physical objects
                        and characters. A character would be the brain,
                        and the object the body of a thing in the game,
                        something that could collide with something 
                        else for instance.  But if I have two different
                        things, they have to be differently implemented 
                        within the game. And so, a game and space engine 
                        were created. The game engine to keep track of 
                        characters that are added to the game (and much 
                        more later on) and the space engine that would 
                        handle physics and everything else that is important
                        for a physical object.</p>
            
                    <p>Then came the behaviors of characters and scenarios
                        for the game. Behaviors handle the way an 
                        object moves and reacts towards other objects. 
                        Scenarios handle what happens in the whole of 
                        space. Particularly this part of the game would 
                        become difficult, but ultimately it worked 
                        exactly how I wanted it too (well, maybe not 
                        exactly). </p>
                </section>
            
                <section>
                    <blockquote>Now it was time for some change and 
                        to see how fast I could make something new. 
                        Something from scratch, but with a time table.
                        That became the half year of pumping out game 
                        after game, most of them half finished, but my 
                        coding skills were being tested and those skills
                        became more apparent. I could see that I was
                        getting much better, very fast.</blockquote>

                <section>
                    <p>So I returned to my cruel mistress of the night,
                        my space game. There it lay, with a smile that
                        told me: "I am way too good for you, and I will
                        always laugh at you, but you keep coming back." 
                        But I knew I could tame this wild beast that I
                        created. And so, I began again. Familiarizing 
                        myself with my own code, shaking my head often
                        when I saw how badly I did some things. I 
                        started fixing bugs, smacking exception after
                        exception to the curb, and little by little
                        it became a game.</p>
            
                    <p>Now I am working on the server side of things, 
                        which is a new chapter in my evolution in the 
                        way of the coder. But this is just another 
                        obstacle in my search of true enlightenment.
                        All I am saying is that in the last two and 
                        a half years, this guy in his thirties, just
                        started teaching himself a skill that is 
                        useful anywhere. The skill of the future! 
                        Something that will be taught to our children 
                        in elementary schools in a couple of years 
                        (I hope). In conclusion: You are never too 
                        old to start learning.</p>
