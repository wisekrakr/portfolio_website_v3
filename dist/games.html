             As a coder we need to experiment and the mind will keep making 
             up new things to create. While I was learning to code, these were 
             the games that came out of that process. Some are very simple, 
             they all look rough, but a rising line of skill is unmistakingly 
             visible.

                        <p>I just figured out how to use Intellij and what 
                            gradle was. I searched for a 2d library to help me 
                            (LibGDX) and this is what came out.</p>

                        <p>I remembered playing a snake game on my Texas 
                            Instruments calculator when I was in high school.

                        <p>After these weak attempts at games I wanted more 
                            animations, more physics, more depth. This game is 
                            so deep, I forgot to put enemies in. Then again, it 
                            does have something fun to look at at least</p>

                        <p>I think every game developer tried to make this game 
                            at one time or another. Not to do anything with, but 
                            just to show the world they can.</p>

                        <p>A great way to start learning game mechanics, is by 
                            developing a simple platformer. You can walk and jump 
                            and shoot, those are the basics of gaming.... right?</p>

                <h3>A small game for a large mind </h3>
                
                <p class="lead">I taught myself coding by making small games, 
                    this one was the first of the bigger ones. I began by making a 
                    ame engine, with the help of LibGDX. This library has easy ways 
                    to add gravity to the game world and make game objects with a 
                    body that can collide with other bodies in the game. But I
                     wanted to make it more challenging for myself, so I began 
                     making an engine so that I could use it in future games I might 
                     want to make. And for me to test my engine I made a break-out 
                     game. Simple blocks, that can be broken with a ball, that you need 
                     to bounce back with a paddle </p>

                <p class="lead">Now that I made a tiny game engine, I could finally poop
                    out all the game I wanted. There was one problem though: I could not 
                    focus on just one idea, so I put them all together, which made the 
                    game very hard to play. There are some bugs and it is hard to complete.
                    That did not matter to me, because I made another step in coding 
                    evolution. </p>

                <p class="lead">This period of development was a bit strange. 
                    I wanted to make something funny and weird and it became very
                     strange and it might be upsetting to some. A game were you
                      fight with your penis. Don't run away yet! It is quite good,
                       if I say so myself. You pick a player, and start the game. 
                       Try do dodge the other men with penisses and try to push 
                       yours up against their head. It gets harder and harder as 
                       you go.... uhmm....the game gets harder and harder as you go. 
                       The point is, I looked better, it played better, it was 
                       overall better than my other games. </p>

                <p class="lead">Unity has been mentioned by people who knew I was 
                    making games. So I began making a small game in Unity. I got 
                    introduced to Visual Studio for the first time, as well as C#.
                     It went smooth. I had confidence in myself and with that I picked 
                     it up within a day. I surprised myself and made this game within 
                     a couple of days maybe. It isn't a big game and not very creative, 
                     but it is the next step in my development as a developer.  </p>

                    A mini game, where I could test my coding skills to make a shooter.
                This took some time to figure out. The hard code was easily done, 
                but the animations and the physics in a 3D world were a headache 
                sometimes. But in the end, I could walk and jump. I could shoot 
                zombies that spawned on different parts of the map. I even made 
                bunnies hop all over the place.... because why not? </p>

                    During the making of all these games, I went back and 
                    forth with this game. It began as a simple beginner

                    and events. It is a rpg-action-space-shooter, where you 
                    are a spaceship that can turn the world 360 degrees to 
                    dodge all kinds of enemies and obstacles, while doing 
                    quests, escorting damsels and flying through asteroid belts. 
                    All my knowledge and skills are interwoven within this 
                    game. It is not done, and it may never will be, but 
                    it brought me to this place of coding enlightenment 
                    and that can only be positive.  </p>
