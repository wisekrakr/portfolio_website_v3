                <p>
                    This is a webpage where I am supposed to talk about myself. 
                    I don't like to do that, especially if I have to	
                    sell myself to others, I'd rather just show it. Then again, 
                    a small introduction would not do me any harm, so here it goes....

                <p>
                The name is David and I do not know what I want to do with my life. 
                Therefore I tried to do as much as possible: taught myself to edit and 
                direct short films, taught myself to play multiple instruments to ultimately 
                sound mix my own music, learned all about the film and music history. 
                Later I studied philosophy, where logic became my love and anthropology and 
                epistomology became my doorway into the human psyche. I got obsessed with 
                everything that has to do with the great "Unknown"; space. I even forced 
                myself to learn more complex math, like trigonometry and later I even 
                learned a bit about machine learning. Since I didn't want to be the only 
                left without <a href="entertainment.html"> a YouTube persona </a>, I even 
                started one of those gaming channels, and got more than ten thousand 
                subscribers. <br>
                After all these different paths to accumulate some sort of knowledge, 
                one thing became clear: "I am not making any money, and I need that 
                for stuff." I needed a skill, for life.... a life-skill if you will.

            <div class="info info-2">
                <aside>
                "So", I asked myself, "maybe I can take all these different paths and 
                see where they all connect." This point of connection was 
                <a href="coding.html">coding!</a>

                For the last couple of years I have been working hard to teach myself 
                while coding different kinds of software. I mostly made 
                <a href="games.html">games</a>, because it's fun and asks a lot of a 
                developer, but I also made some small apps and a twitter api bot, 
                just to see if I could.... and I could!    
                To summarize, I am an absurdist, wise, childish, passionate, 
                analytical, paradoxical, "trying to be funny" human being, 
                that loves to mix logic with creativity to make all kinds of funny, 
                cool, beautiful and useful stuff... I am trying at least.
